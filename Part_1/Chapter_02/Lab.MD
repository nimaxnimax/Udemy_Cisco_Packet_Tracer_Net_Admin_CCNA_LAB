Lab:

1- Configure IP addresses for both end devices in subnet A >> range: 192.168.11.0/24 or 192.168.11.0 255.255.255.0

2- Configure IP addresses for both end devices in subnet B >> range: 192.168.13.0/24 or 192.168.13.0 255.255.255.0

3- Check IP connectivity for end devices in subnet A

4- Check IP connectivity for end devices in subnet B

5- Subnet A devices have no connectivity with devices in subnet B

6- Check IP configurations on end devices

7- Check MAC address table on switch

8- Clear ARP cache on end devices

9- Add another end devices (PCs) and hubs in subnets A and B and connect to hub and different port of the switch and test the connectivity within subnet A and subnet B and check mac address table of the switch and arp cache of the end devices
